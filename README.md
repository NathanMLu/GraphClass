This is a graph class that implements all standard methods. It is bi-directional (undirected) and weighted. It is assumed that weights cannot be negative and vertices cannot be duplicate in any way. 
Linked lists, stacks, queues, and vectors will be used to implement this data structure, and each vertex in the graph will hold an id and an information.
